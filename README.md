A coremod to save a few of these:

or rather their modern equivalent: RAM.

I am working on getting at least some of the changes made by this mod into Forge (
see [this issue](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/7559) for progress), features will be removed
from the Forge version of FerriteCore if and when they are added to Forge. They will still be present on Fabric. For a
high-level description of the improvements implemented by this mod see [here](summary.md).

### Mappings

This mod currently uses MCP names for everything, in case someone involved in MCP mapping wants to look at it. There are
a few commits using official names, so be careful when looking at the commit history if you are concerned about "mapping
taint".
