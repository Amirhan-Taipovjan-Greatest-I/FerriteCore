A coremod to save a few of these:

or rather their modern equivalent: RAM.

I am working on getting at least some of the changes made by this mod into Forge (
see [this issue](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/7559) for progress), features will be removed
from the Forge version of FerriteCore if and when they are added to Forge. They will still be present on Fabric. For a
high-level description of the improvements implemented by this mod see [here](summary.md).

### Mappings

This mod currently uses official/Mojmap names for everything, some of the history is in MCP names. If you don't know
what this means it most likely isn't relevant to you, this information is mostly for people who do not want to see names
in these mappings for legel reasons.
