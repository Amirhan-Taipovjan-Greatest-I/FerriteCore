A coremod to save a few of these:

I am working on getting at least some of the changes made by this mod into Forge, features will be removed here if and
when they are added to Forge. For a description of the improvements implemented by this mod see [here](summary.md).

### Mappings

This mod currently uses MCP names for everything, in case someone involved in MCP mapping wants to look at it. There are
a few commits using official names, so be careful when looking at the commit history if you are concerned about "mapping
taint".
